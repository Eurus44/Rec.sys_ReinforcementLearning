# Reinforcement learning for Recommendation Systems

Implement the technique of using deep reinforcement learning for recommendation with explicit modeling of user-item interactions with others algorithm PPO and SAC instead of DDPG, as described in the paper at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12027.pdf. Code from the [higgsfield's RL-Adventure](https://github.com/higgsfield/RL-Adventure-2/) repository was utilized in the implementation process, providing valuable assistance
