# Reinforcement learning for Recommendation Systems

The PPO, DDPG, and SAC algorithms were used to implement the technique of using deep reinforcement learning for recommendation with explicit modeling of user-item interactions, as described in the paper at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12027.pdf. Code from the [higgsfield's RL-Adventure](https://github.com/higgsfield/RL-Adventure-2/) repository was utilized in the implementation process, providing valuable assistance
