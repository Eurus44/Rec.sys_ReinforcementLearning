# Reinforcement learning for Recommendation Systems


Implement the method described in the publication at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12027.pdf, which uses explicit modeling of user-item interactions with other algorithms PPO and SAC in place of DDPG for recommendation. RL-Adventure code from the higgsfield was used in the implementation process, which was very helpful.
